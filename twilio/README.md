You can use this SMS software http://smsenabler.com. It can automatically post incoming SMS messages to the URL of your PHP script and send back reply SMS messages.

It uses a 3G/GSM modem (dongle) plugged in a computer to receive SMS. Such modems/dongles have a SIM card inside, therefore they have a phone number to which text messages can be sent.







You can use www.aql.com to receive SMS messages into your application. May work best in the UK
